Key-exchange protocols that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. 

1. Caesar cipher algorithm is an algorithm by replacing the initial letter position with alphabet or called ROT3 algorithm. Transposition algorithm that is by changing the location of text message to be encoded by using certain form.

2. The Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) Algorithm is a key-exchange protocol that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. DH enables the two to use a public key to encrypt and decrypt their conversation or data using symmetric cryptography.

3. The KDC will use cryptographic techniques to authenticate requesting users as themselves. It will also check whether an individual user has the right to access the service requested. If the authenticated user meets all prescribed conditions, the KDC can issue a ticket permitting access.

4. RSA encryption algorithm is a type of public-key encryption algorithm. To better understand RSA, lets first understand what is public-key encryption algorithm.

Public Key encryption algorithm is also called the Asymmetric algorithm. Asymmetric algorithms are those algorithms in which sender and receiver use different keys for encryption and decryption. Each sender is assigned a pair of keys:
-- Public key
-- Private key
